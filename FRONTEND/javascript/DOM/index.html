<h2>Creation and Development</h2>
<p id="description">
    In 1962,with the success of fantastic four,marvel comics editor and head writer stan lee was casting for a new superhero idea.
    he said the idea for spider-man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens
    could identify. As  with fantastic four, lee saw spiderman as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in 
    comic books
